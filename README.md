# E-commerce shop with shoes

Project made to practice tailwindcss. There is an option to filter brands and categories as well as sort filtered products by price or alphabetically. Whole shop default settings are easily configurable by changing DEFAULT variables. In the project I am also using libraries such as framer-motion, react-lazy-load-image-component and clsx
